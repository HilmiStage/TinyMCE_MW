TinyMCE_MW
==========

TinyMCE Editor for use with MediaWiki

This is a repository created to continue the work started by Joseph P. Socoloski III in 2007 on the TinyMCE for
MediaWiki on the Extension:TinyMCE_MW page at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TinyMCE_MW

I am going to do my best to keep it up to date.

The current version of TinyMCE in this repository is 3.3.9.
I currently have it operational on MediaWiki 1.20 master branch dated June 19, 2012. 

I have tested it in Firefox 13.0.1, Chrome 19.0.1084.56, Safari 5.1.7, IE 7, IE 8, IE 9, and IE 9 Compatibility Mode.

For configuration instructions, refer to the above Extension Page.
